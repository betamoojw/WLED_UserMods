# Xiaozhi_MCP Usermod

# Note

This user mode leverages the xiaozhi-esp32-mcp as backend service to establish the connection/bidirectional communication to xiaozhi.me with the following adjustments:

* Use the xiaozhi_mcp-1.0.0.zip fetched from the https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/xiaozhi-mcp and only keep the WebSocketMCP.h and WebSocketMCP.cpp files at minimal for Xiaozhi_MCP user mode.
* Use the wled.h header instead of the ones in the original header list (the wled project has built-in ArduinoJson.h).
