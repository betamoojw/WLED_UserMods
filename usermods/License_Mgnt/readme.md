Copy all the content in the section `RO Device ID For Key` in License_Mgnt and send it to the vendor for key generation and service authorization. Without the device key, it will have a 60-minute FREE trial. 

Go to your device host ip + `/edit` (e.g. http://192.168.71.24/edit) in browser and import the key file naming `DEVICE_KEY`.
